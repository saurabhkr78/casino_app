In this game, the player starts with a cash amount of $100. The game involves guessing the position of the ‘Queen’ card in a shuffled set of three cards - ‘Jack’, ‘Queen’, and ‘King’. The player enters their betting amount for each round. The cards are then shuffled virtually, and the player is asked to guess the position of the queen.
